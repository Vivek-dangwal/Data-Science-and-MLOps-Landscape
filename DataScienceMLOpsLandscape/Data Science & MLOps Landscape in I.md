# &nbsp;Data Science \& MLOps Landscape in Industry



###### &nbsp;Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced **data analysis and visualization of data** science jobs worldwide.  

It explores salary trends, job roles, experience levels, and company locations using Python, Pandas, and Plotly.



The project covers **all major visualization types**: bar charts, box plots, doughnut charts, heatmaps, parallel categories, bubble charts, funnel charts, radar charts, icicle charts, and interactive maps.

###### &nbsp;Project Steps



###### &nbsp;1️⃣ Data Loading \& Cleaning

\- Loaded dataset using Pandas

\- Dropped unnecessary columns (`Unnamed: 0`)

\- Checked column names and data types



###### &nbsp;2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

\- Count of job roles

\- Top countries for data science jobs

\- Experience level analysis

\- Salary statistics



###### &nbsp;3️⃣ Visualizations



a) Top 5 Data Science Job Roles (Bar Chart)





&nbsp;b) Salary Distribution by Experience Level (Box Chart)





&nbsp;c) Employment Type Distribution (Doughnut Chart)





d) Average Salary by Job Title and Experience Level (Heatmap)





&nbsp;e) Experience Level vs Employment Type vs Company Size (Parallel Categories)





&nbsp;f) Salary vs Experience Level (Bubble Chart)





g) Top 5 Job Roles by Average Salary (Funnel Chart)





&nbsp;h) Average Salary by Experience Level for Top Job Roles (Radar Chart)





&nbsp;i) Job Distribution by Company Size → Employment Type → Experience Level (Icicle Chart)
